# Shell, basics
## the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

* A script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory. [Where am I?](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/0-current_working_directory)

* Display the contents list of your current directory. [What’s in there?](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/1-listit)

* Write a script that changes the working directory to the user’s home directory. [There is no place like home](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/2-bring_me_home)

* Display current directory contents in a long format. [The long format](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/3-listfiles)

* Display current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Use the long format. [Hidden files](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/4-listmorefiles)

* Display current directory contents. [I love numbers](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/5-listfilesdigitonly)

* Create a script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory. [Welcome](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/6-firstdirectory)

* Move the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory. [Betty in my first directory](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/7-movethatfile)

* Delete the file betty. [Bye bye Betty](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/8-firstdelete)

* Delete the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory. [Bye bye My first directory](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/9-firstdirdeletion)

* Write a script that changes the working directory to the previous one. [Back to the future](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/10-back)

* Write a script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format. [Lists](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/11-lists)

* Write a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script. [File type](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/12-file_type)
