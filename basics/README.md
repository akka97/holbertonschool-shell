# Shell, basics
## the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

* A script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory. [Where am I?](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/0-current_working_directory)

* Display the contents list of your current directory. [What’s in there?](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/1-listit)

* Write a script that changes the working directory to the user’s home directory. [There is no place like home](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/2-bring_me_home)

* Display current directory contents in a long format. [The long format](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/3-listfiles)

* Display current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Use the long format. [Hidden files](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/4-listmorefiles)

* Display current directory contents. [I love numbers](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/5-listfilesdigitonly)

* Create a script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory. [Welcome](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/6-firstdirectory)

* Move the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory. [Betty in my first directory](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/7-movethatfile)

* Delete the file betty. [Bye bye Betty](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/8-firstdelete)

* Delete the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory. [Bye bye My first directory](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/9-firstdirdeletion)

* Write a script that changes the working directory to the previous one. [Back to the future](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/10-back)

* Write a script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format. [Lists](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/11-lists)

* Write a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script. [File type](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/12-file_type)

* Create a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory. [We are symbols, and inhabit symbols](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/13-symbolic_link)

* Create a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory. [Copy HTML files](https://github.com/akka97/holbertonschool-shell/blob/main/basics/14-copy_html)
